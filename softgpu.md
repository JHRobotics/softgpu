## Virtual GPU

Historically video card in Virtual Machines were designed for only rendering framebuffer - they're simply to implement, both on hypervisor side and on BIOS/firmware in VM, drivers for OS in VM are simply too and on most cases there not needed and most modern OS can use to some basic drawing using (video) BIOS calls. This is logical, because VM are usually used as servers, and you don't want to waste resources on something that is not visible. This is important to know because (by my opinion) most problem with graphic on virtual desktop is that these technologies were developed for server use and has been only a bit fixed for desktop usage.

Following are the most common types of virtual video adapters:

### Bochs VBE Extensions (aka VBoxVGA or -vga std)

On this API is based basic video adapter in VirtualBox (VBoxVGA) and on QEMU (`-vga std`). There is no 2D or 3D acceleration support in this video card. SoftGPU support VirtualBox and QEMU variant but all drawing is done by software. It is slow but is most compatible and works in all cases. Key feature for speed of SW rendering is SSE instructions (at least SSE 3) support on VM and virtual OS (>= Windows 98).

### VMware SVGA3D (aka VBoxSVGA or VMSVGA)

This is real (virtual) GPU and SoftGPU can use this for accelerated rendering. This GPU can occur in multiple variant.

#### SVGA-II (aka -vga vmware)

Simplest variant supported event in QEMU but with very limited 2D acceleration. This variant still using full software rendering with similar results as VBE. To this variant is GPU degraded if is 3D acceleration turned off in VMware or VirtualBox.

QEMU isn't support 8 and 16 bit modes, SoftGPU can work on it, but most games won't start. Please use `-vga std` in QEMU instead.

#### SVGA3D gen.9 (vGPU9)

Supported by VMware and VirtualBox 6.1 and 7.0, mainly designed for accelerate DX 9 drawing (usually for Windows Vista and 7 aero). Limiting is shader model used in this GPU and isn't possible to use pixel/vertex shaders in DX8 and DX9 games. Again, isn't possible use Mesa Nine (DX9 translation to native driver) with this GPU variant.

#### SVGA3D gen.10 (vGPU10)

Supported in VirtualBox 7.0. and VMware. This is designed for Windows 10 for DirectX 11/12 support - DirectX 12 can emulate all older DX variant and native DDI isn't needed (but this works only on W7 and W10/W11).

DX8/DX9/OpenGL Shader are supported, and most DX 9 games works, OpenGL rendering in games is faster than with vGPU9. This is actually most preferred way to use with SoftGPU. Disadvantage of using vGPU10 is that all textures are stored in VM RAM so you need more RAM to attach to VM. 512 MB RAM is minimum recommended value for vGPU10 and for Windows 9x is value also maximum recommended without additional patches.

#### SVGA-III

Newest variant primary developed for ARM devices, currently not supported by SoftGPU. (But when this will be supported on VirtualBox or another opensource HV, I will include support of this to SoftGPU too).


### VirGL

This virtual GPU for QEMU, potentially faster than SVGA3D. Not supported by SoftGPU yet.

### Real GPU (PCI passthrough)

This is connection of real GPU to virtual machine. Works (as I known) only on QEMU in Linux (as Host). Need extra GPU compatible with Windows 9x - I personally had relative success with PCI express variant of nvidia 6600/6600 GT. You also need specific HW (free PCI express slot, VT-d CPU support, mother board support for PCIe slot isolation and second monitor + keyboard and mouse). I also observe very massive performance loss. I recommend this only for most advanced users. SoftGPU is no needed there because you can use native GPU drivers.

### Virtual GPU (PCI passthrough)

Some GPUs allow to split the real GPU to multiple virtual GPUs and attach them to virtual machines. This feature isn't commonly present in gaming hardware (for example for nvidia you need quadro card), only common technology is Intel GVT-g. But there are no drivers for Windows 9x guest. I see too many problems to consider support in SoftGPU.

### Emulated GPU

This is domain for emulators. Software like DOSBox (DOSBox-X) and PCem allow emulate real GPU like S3 Trio or S3 ViRGE and 3D accelerator like Voodoo/Voodoo2. This allows to use unchanged legacy software and driver. SoftGPU support is not needed here.


## 3D passthrough

This technique creates side channel so 3D commands do not go to virtual GPU, but they are serialized and send to host machine where are unpacked and send to real GPU. This is much simpler than create full-weight virtual GPU. Can be do it over shared memory or via network. Disadvantages are problems with transporting rendered image back to VM (for example to draw in Window or postprocess) and with multiple contexts (more different application want render own graphics same time). There are some solutions:

### QEMU-3Dfx

More on [QEMU-3Dfx page](https://github.com/kjliew/qemu-3dfx). SoftGPU is supporting this. See instructions on [GitHub main page](https://github.com/JHRobotics/softgpu/#qemu-3dfx-usage) how to use.

### Chromium

This is [very old software](https://chromium.sourceforge.net/), but it's modification was used in VirtualBox to version 5.1 to accelerate 3D rendering. Currently is abandoned and not supported by SoftGPU.


## Virtual Machine configuration

General tips how to configure individual software is on [Github project main page](https://github.com/JHRobotics/softgpu/).


## Installation

Mount SoftGPU CD or unpack zip package to VM HDD and run softgpu.exe, revise options (default are recommended for most users and configurations) and click on **Install** button.

Options descriptions follow:

### Binaries types

SoftGPU support 2 differed CPU architectures:

**Pentium II** is mainly for Windows 95 natively which supports only MMX instruction set (and event with SSE hack is required to minimize usage of SSE/AVX instructions to only one application) or when your virtual CPU is emulated and advanced instruction isn't available.

**SSE 3** is for Windows 95/98 and is much faster and because I want to keep compatibility with old Intel Core2 architecture, is SSE instruction set limited to SSE3.

**SSE 4.2** using maximum CPU extensions which Windows 98/Me supporting. Speed is slightly faster than **SSE3** but depends on CPU. There binaries aren't included in standard releases, I'm including them to edition for supporters as gift for their support. But in every case you can build them yourself by add this `CFLAGS` to `config.mk`:

```TUNE += -march=westmere```


### Wrappers

Currently GPU driver natively support **DirectDraw**, **DirectX** (DDI 8 - allow run programs up to DirectX 9 API level) and **OpenGL**. When native interface isn't 100 % complete you translation graphical API to other, that is supported.

#### Wine D3D (Wine9x)

Translating DirectDraw and DirectX to OpenGL. Although Wine has many bugs and graphical glitches it is still preferred way to emulate DirectX.

#### Mesa Nine (Mesa9x)

Translating DirectX 9 directly to driver primitives (if is based on Mesa3D library) and in theory should be faster than Wine. But require higher shader model so works only for vGPU10. Also Wine solving some quirks in Windows software so is more compatible and stable than Nine.

#### Eight-to-Nine (Mesa9x)

Since Nine supporting only, DX9 there is wrapper to translate DX8 to DX9. It is based on [d3d8to9](https://github.com/crosire/d3d8to9) project. All is statically linked to one DLL, so you don't need to worry about DLL ping-pong. Is is slightly faster than Wine.


#### OpenGlide (OpenGlide9x)

This wrapper is translating 3Dfx Glide to OpenGL. Currently is supported only Glide2x and Glide3x. This wrapper isn't ideal but I making slowly progress. Glide for DOS is not supported and support is not planed. You can use DOS Glide with [QEMU-3Dfx](https://github.com/kjliew/qemu-3dfx), but binaries no included in SoftGPU package.

#### MiniGL

This wrapper was designed to translate OpenGL to (3DFX proprietary) Glide2 or Glide3 API. Usually used for Quake 2/3 engine based games. Since Voodoo 3 was abandoned to native OpenGL implementation. OpenGlide9x now supports these wrappers results OpenGL → Glide → OpenGL transport. But why to do this? There is 2 situations: 1st is fail-safe, so incorrect installation/setup (wrappers were parts of some distributions) can work somehow. 2nd is for games that will not work correctly with Mesa3D OpenGL implementation.

**Usage**

You need some original files:
- Voodoo2 driver (V3.02.02), from [here](http://falconfly.3dfx.pl/minigl.htm) or [my mirror](https://files.emulace.cz/voodoo2-30202.zip)
- 3dfx MiniGL (V1.49, from [here](http://falconfly.3dfx.pl/minigl.htm) or [my mirror](https://files.emulace.cz/minigl149.zip)

From Voodoo2 driver copy `3dfxVGL.dll`, `3dfxSpl2.dll` and `3dfxSpl3.dll` to *WINDOWS/SYSTEM* folder. For games: (GL)Quake, Quake 2, Half Life, Heretic 2, Hexen 2 and Sin copy individual **.dll* from MiniGL archive to game directory (usually there is file with same name, overwrite it). I'm currently recommending to use MiniGL for these games:

- Soldier of Fortune
- Quake 2 (with vGPU10)
- Sin (with vGPU10)
- Heretic II (with vGPU10)

For Quake 3 and RTCW is OpenGlide disabled, because it causes more problems than benefits.
 

### VRAM and GMR

## Registry configuration

Where are example how registry configuration work, you can save there example as text file with REG extension and apply them on double click or open `regedit.exe` edit these value directly (create these key when missing).

### DirectX/DirectDraw wrapper selection

Some application won't work or not working well with Wine, for 2D application you can use native DirectDraw HAL. Media player is one of them:

```
REGEDIT4


[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\vmdisp9x\apps\exe\MPLAYER2.exe]
"ddraw"="system"

```

Some 2D games have these problems to, for example The Sims:

```
REGEDIT4


[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\vmdisp9x\apps\exe\sims.exe]
"ddraw"="system"

```

You can also select native DirectDraw HAL by default, and turn on wine for individual applications:

```
REGEDIT4


[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\vmdisp9x\apps\global]
"ddraw"="system"

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\vmdisp9x\apps\exe\rayman2.exe]
"ddraw"="wine"

```

For DX8 and DX9 you can switch between HEL (there isn't native DirectX HAL) - but application needs support software/emulated rendering, Wine or Nine (Mesa DirectX 9 driver). Using Nine for DX8 (when is supported) game (Mafia):

```
REGEDIT4


[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\vmdisp9x\apps\exe\game.exe]
"d3d8"="nine"

```

Nine for DX9 game (CMR 3):

```
REGEDIT4


[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\vmdisp9x\apps\exe\Rally_3PC.exe]
"d3d9"="nine"

```

Supported values are: *system* (pass calls to system DLL), *wine* (using Wine9x), *nine* (use nine for DX9 when is supported), *ninemore* (Nine for DX 8 and DX 9), *nineforce* (try use Nine even when looks like unsupported) or value can be name of DLL (with path or only file name) to wrapper DLL (can be used for example with SwiftShader).

### Mesa3D

Old OpenGL games have problem with too large extension string Quake II is on of them:

```
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\vmdisp9x\apps\exe\quake2.exe\mesa]
"MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR"="2000"
```

When you using software rendering and [SIMD95](https://github.com/JHRobotics/simd95) for enable AXV instruction set, it is recommended to use them only with one application Q3 for example:

```
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\vmdisp9x\apps\exe\quake2.exe\mesa]
"LP_NATIVE_VECTOR_WIDTH"="256"
```

Possible configuration values here are: https://docs.mesa3d.org/envvars.html

### Wine

Default Wine registry path also working: https://wiki.winehq.org/Useful_Registry_Keys

But also working same registry path scheme as for Mesa, for example increase VRAM memory to 256 MB (Video RAM is emulated anyway, you can use any value when you have enough system RAM):


```
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\vmdisp9x\apps\global\wine]
"VideoMemorySize"="256"
```


### QEMU 3DFX
